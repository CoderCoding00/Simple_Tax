# Simple Tax Instructions  
```md 
Given a salary as input, print the amount of tax you would owe if you make that salary.

The tax is based on your tax bracket as found from the first two columns below.

Once you know which row to use,
start with the "flat amount" and add the "plus %" of the amount over the amount listed in the final column.

For example, if your income is $50,000,
then you use the third row of the table and compute the tax as $4,000 plus 25% of the amount over $29,050, which comes to $9,237.50.

The total tax on $27,500 is $3,767.50. For $6,000, the tax is $600. For $120,000, the tax is $28,227.
